Terms 

The License shall continue for as long as you use the software but shall not be transferrable to any third party.  You agree to destroy all copies of the software should you decide to terminate this agreement.  The limitations of our warranty and liability, defined below, will still remain in force after such termination.   

Intellectual Property Rights

You acknowledge that all intellectual property rights in the software anywhere in the world belong to us, that rights in the software are licensed (not sold) to you, and that you have no rights in, or to, the software or any accompanying documentation other than the right to use them in accordance with the terms of this Licence.

Warranty 

Due to the complexity of software and in line with the usual practices of the software industry, McLaren Applied Limited makes no warranty, representation, promise or guarantee, either express or implied, statutory or otherwise with respect to the software, user documentation or any related technical support including their quality, performance, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. 
 
Software Support 

Where the software is a standard product[1], we will offer telephone support for a period of three months after shipment.  Reported faults will be recorded.  We will decide, at our own discretion, if and when a recorded fault will be fixed in future releases.  New releases will not be automatically provided to customers.  The decision to make available a minor release (e.g. V7.3 -> V7.4) to a specific customer will be made at our discretion.  In the case of a major release (e.g. V6 -> V7), there will be an upgrade fee associated with the transaction. 
 
Bespoke software developed under a fixed price contract[2] will only have faults fixed during the agreed commissioning phase.  After this time it shall be considered to be standard software and treated accordingly (see above).  
 
Software developed under an Engineering Assistance Account will not carry any warranty.  Fixing any faults will be considered to be part of the job and will be invoiced as agreed in the Engineering Assistance Account. 
 
Software developed by a design team, contracted by a customer to support one or more projects, will not carry any warranty.  Fixing any faults will be considered to be part of the job and will be done by the dedicated team (as long as it exists) within their agreed working hours. 
 
Liability

In no case shall the liability of McLaren Applied Limited or any associated company exceed the amount paid by you for the software.

Nothing in this Agreement shall exclude any liability of McLaren Applied Limited for representations made fraudulently or any written representations signed by an authorised representative of McLaren Applied Limited. 

We will not be liable or responsible for any failure to perform, or delay in performance of, any of our obligations under this Licence that is caused by an event that is beyond our reasonable control.
